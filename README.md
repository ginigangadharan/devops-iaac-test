# Infra As A Code Demo

Provision a new VM via IaC, and deploy a webserver
via SCM tool
### Write Infrastructure-as-code and configuration-as-code recipes (using your
preferred orchestration software) to:
o Create the server (can be AWS or Azure based)
o Configure an OS image (your choice) appropriately.
o Deploy Nginx webserver.
o Make the Nginx webserver available on port 80.
o Ensure that the server is locked down and secure.

### Provide documentation:
o Instructions for the reviewer which explain how your code should be
executed
o Requirements for running. (Azure account? Base images? Other
tooling pre-installed?)
o Explanation of assumptions and design choices.

Test can be submitted via Github, Public Repo URL
